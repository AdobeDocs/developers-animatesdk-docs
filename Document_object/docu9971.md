## document.silent

#### Availability

Flash MX 2004.

#### Usage

document.silent

#### Description

Property; a Boolean value that specifies whether the object is accessible. This is equivalent to the inverse logic of the Make Movie Accessible setting in the Accessibility panel. That is, if document.silent is true, it is the same as the Make Movie Accessible option being unchecked. If it is false, it is the same as the Make Movie Accessible option being checked.

#### Example

```javascript
The following example sets the isSilent variable to the value of the silent property:
var isSilent = fl.getDocumentDOM().silent;

The following example sets the silent property to false, indicating that the document is accessible:
fl.getDocumentDOM().silent = false;

```

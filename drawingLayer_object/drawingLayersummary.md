## drawingLayersummary

#### Availability

Flash MX 2004.

#### Description

The drawingLayer object is accessible from JavaScript as a child of the flash object. The drawingLayer object is used for extensible tools when the user wants to temporarily draw while draggingâ€”for example, when creating a selection marquee. You should call [drawingLayer.beginFrame()](../drawingLayer_object/drawingLaye1.md) before you call any other drawingLayer methods.

#### Method summary

The following methods are available for the drawingLayer object:

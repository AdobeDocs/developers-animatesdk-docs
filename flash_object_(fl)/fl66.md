## fl.scriptURI

#### Availability

Flash CS3 Professional.

#### Usage

fl.scriptURI

#### Description

Read-only property; a string that represents the path of the currently running JSFL script, expressed as a file:/// URI. If the script was called from [fl.runScript()](#_bookmark529), this property represents the path of the immediate parent script. That is, it doesnâ€™t traverse multiple calls to [fl.runScript()](#_bookmark529) to find the path of the original calling script.

#### Example

```
The following example displays the path of the currently running JSFL script in the Output panel:
fl.trace(fl.scriptURI);

```

## fl.swfPanels

#### Availability

> Flash CS4 Professional.

#### Usage

> fl.swfPanels

#### Description

> Read-only property; an array of registered swfPanel objects (see [swfPanel object](#_bookmark904)). A swfPanel object is registered if it has been opened at least once.
>
> A panelâ€™s position in the array represents the order in which it was opened. If the first panel opened is named TraceBitmap and the second panel opened is named AnotherFunction, then fl.swfPanels\[0\] is the TraceBitmap swfPanel object, fl.swfPanels\[1\] is the AnotherFunction swfPanel object, and so on.
>
> This property is undefined if none of panels have been opened (this behavior is new in Adobe Animate).

#### Example

> The following code displays the name and path of any registered Window SWF panels in the Output panel:
>
> if(fl.swfPanels.length \> 0){
>
> for(x = 0; x \< fl.swfPanels.length; x++){
>
> fl.trace("Panel: " + fl.swfPanels\[x\].name + " -- Path: " + fl.swfPanels\[x\].path);
>
> }
>
> }

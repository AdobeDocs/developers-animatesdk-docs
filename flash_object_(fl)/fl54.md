## fl.publishDocument()

#### Availability

> Flash CS5 Professional.

#### Usage

> fl.publishDocument( flaURI \[, publishProfile\] )

#### Parameters

> **flaURI** A string, expressed as a file:/// URI, that specifies the path of the FLA file that should be silently published.
>
> **publishProfile** A string that specifies the publish profile to use when publishing. If this parameter is omitted, the default publish profile is used.

#### Returns

> Boolean

#### Description

> Method; publishes a FLA file without opening it. This API opens the FLA in a headless mode and publishes the SWF (or whatever the profile is set to). The second parameter (publishProfile) is optional. The return value is a boolean indicating if the profile was found or not. In the case where the second parameter is not supplied, the return value is always true.

#### Example

> The following example prompts the user to select a FLA file and silently publishes it using the “Default” publish profile:
>
> var uri = fl.browseForFileURL("select", "select a FLA file to publish"); var publishProfileName = "Default";
>
> fl.publishDocument(uri, publishProfileName);

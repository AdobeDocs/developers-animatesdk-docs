## fl.openDocument()

#### Availability

Flash MX 2004.

#### Usage

fl.openDocument(fileURI)

#### Parameters

**fileURI** A string, expressed as a file:/// URI, that specifies the name of the file to be opened.

#### Returns

The [Document object](#_bookmark116) for the newly opened document, if the method is successful. If the file is not found or is not a valid FLA file, an error is reported and the script is cancelled.

#### Description

Method; opens a Flash document (FLA file) for editing in a new Flash Document window and gives it focus. For a user, the effect is the same as selecting File \Open and then selecting a file. If the specified file is already open, the window that contains the document comes to the front. The window that contains the specified file becomes the currently selected document.

#### Example

```
The following example opens a file named Document.fla that is stored in the root directory on the C drive. The code stores a Document object representing that document in the doc variable and sets the document to be the currently selected document. That is, until focus is changed, fl.getDocumentDOM() refers to this document.
var doc = fl.openDocument("file:///c\|/Document.fla");
